# Web_Dev_Color_Picker
A simple color picker app, written with HTML and Javascript, using Bootstrap CSS and JQuery.

## Why?
Over the last couple of days (as of this writing), I have started an effort to learn web development by doing challenges on
**FreeCodeCamp.com**. I have decided to suppliment the challenges on this site with some projects of my own. The first of these
projects is a simple color picker app, written with HTML, JS, Bootstrap, and JQuery, which demonstrates some of what I
have learned so far.

## How to Use
Use the three sliders at the center of the page to change the background color of the webpage. You'll see RGB values and a
Hexidecimal representation of the colors you select. That's all there is to it.
